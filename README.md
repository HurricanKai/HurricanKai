I'm working on serverless, FaaS, edge - I'm a platforms engineer at heart. Originally in C#/.NET, now in Rust/WASM & Zig.

I know JS/React/Svelte but prefer being a backend developer :smile:

Performance & efficency should be part of any toolkit and I try to build anything with performance out of the box.

Used to work professionally, now Student @ [KIT](https://kit.edu)
